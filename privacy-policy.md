The PetSoLive project is designed to create a communication network for pet owners, veterinarians, shelters, and animal welfare community members. Its goals include improving communication between pet owners and veterinarians, fostering a community approach to animal welfare, providing emergency support, and optimizing animal adoption processes.

Based on the information available in the GitHub repository, PetSoLive stores "all user information and media files" within its data layer. However, the repository does not specify the exact types of user information collected (e.g., names, email addresses, location data) or provide detailed information on how these data and media files are used.

Therefore, I cannot generate a comprehensive and legally sound `privacy policy.md` without more specific details regarding:

* **Types of Data Collected**: What specific personal information (e.g., name, contact details, location, pet information) and media files are collected from users.
* **Purpose of Data Collection**: How each type of collected data is used to provide the services of PetSoLive.
* **Data Sharing**: Whether any data is shared with third parties and, if so, with whom and for what purpose.
* **Data Security**: Measures taken to protect user data.
* **User Rights**: How users can access, correct, or delete their data.
* **Data Retention**: How long user data is stored.
* **Cookies and Tracking Technologies**: If any such technologies are used and for what purpose.

To create a proper privacy policy, the project developers would need to clearly define these aspects.
