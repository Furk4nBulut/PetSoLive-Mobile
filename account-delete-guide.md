# Bulutsoft - PetSoLive-Mobile Application Account and Data Deletion Policy

This policy outlines the procedures for users of the **PetSoLive-Mobile** application, provided by Bulutsoft, to delete their accounts and associated data. We prioritize our users' privacy and aim to give them full control over their personal data.

## Account Deletion Request and Steps

Our users can request the deletion of their accounts and all associated personal data related to the **PetSoLive-Mobile** application. Here are the steps you need to follow to delete your account:

1.  **Request via Email (Current Method):**
    * You can submit your account deletion request to the Bulutsoft support team via email.
    * Send an email from the address associated with your **PetSoLive-Mobile** account to `bulutsoftdev@gmail.com`.
    * Please use "**PetSoLive-Mobile Account Deletion Request**" as the subject line of your email and clearly state your username/ID and your request for account deletion in the body of the email.
    * We may need to verify your identity to process your request. Please provide any additional information if requested.

2.  **Direct In-App Deletion (Future Feature):**
    * To enhance user experience, **we plan to introduce a direct in-app account deletion feature in our future updates for the PetSoLive-Mobile application.** This will allow our users to easily delete their accounts through an "Delete My Account" option within the app, without needing to send an additional email. When this feature becomes available, the necessary instructions will be provided within the application.

Once your account deletion request is received, we aim to complete the process within **[e.g., 30 days]**. During this period, some data may be kept in a **[temporarily inactive/restorable]** state.

## Types of Data Deleted and Retained

Upon your account deletion request, the following types of data associated with the **PetSoLive-Mobile** application will be **[permanently deleted/anonymized]**:

* **[Username, email address, profile information (e.g., pet details, photos).]**
* **[Personal interactions and content created within the app (e.g., posts, comments, messages).]**
* **[Location data (if applicable and stored).]**
* **[Payment information (if in-app purchases are involved and stored; sensitive data like this is typically processed by partners for PCI DSS compliance, not directly by the app).]**

In certain situations, some data types may be retained for additional periods:

* **Legal Obligations:** Data that Bulutsoft is legally required to retain to comply with legal regulations (e.g., tax, accounting laws). Such data is typically retained for legal periods of **[e.g., 5-10 years]**. This data may be **[anonymized or pseudonymized]** and accessible only for legal compliance purposes.
* **Functional Requirements:** Anonymized or aggregated data necessary for the core functionality of the application but which does not directly identify you (e.g., app performance, error logs, general usage statistics). This data may be used **[indefinitely]** for the development and improvement of the application.
* **Security and Fraud Prevention:** Specific transaction logs or IP addresses, for instance, may be retained for a **[specific period, e.g., 90 days]** to prevent and investigate security incidents or fraudulent activities.

All retained data will be protected in accordance with legal and security standards and will only be used for specified purposes.
